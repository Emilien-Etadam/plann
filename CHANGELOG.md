# Changelog

Development on 0.x is going on fast-paced and erratic, with the
priority of getting a tool the author can use for his daily planning.
Changelogs will be kept rather minimalistic until v1.0 has been
released.  Since this technically is a fork of calendar-cli (though
almost everything is written from scratch), release v0.15.0 is like
the first proper release.

The format of this file is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and I do try to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v0.15.0] - 2023-07-19

First release of plann (as of v0.14 it was a part of calendar-cli).  Development up until v0.15 has been fast-paced and erratic, prioritizing to "get things to work out well enough for the author".  The tool works for me, but has plenty of rough edges.
