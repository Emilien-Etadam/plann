TL;DR: run test_calendar-cli.sh, don't run tests.sh.

Probably we should add some standard python test code here that can be run through nose or tox, but after all this is a command line utility - hence I found it appropriate to start with functional tests written to be executed from through a shell.

The file tests.sh will run towards whatever calendar server is configured in .config/calendar.conf, and it has potential side effects, it will wipe out any prior events within the time range 2010-10-10 and 2010-10-14.

The file test_calendar-cli.sh will set up a radicale calendar server, run the tests.sh towards radicale, then set up xandikos and run tests.sh towards xandikos.
